## Project Overview

This lightweight Web application shows the weather for any given location. The application should prompt users for their device's location, but they should also be able to provide the location manually. Temperature, weather conditions, and a generic image will be shown to the user corresponding to that location's weather. Basic requirements are defined in [this freeCodeCamp exercise](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-the-local-weather/) and expanded features and goals are outlined in [our wiki (work in progress)](https://github.com/nashvillefcc/local-weather-app/wiki).

The code on this GitHub repo is for the front-end side of our application. The APIs we will utilize for weather information and other resources are still TBD. The application is currently being written in standard HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.

This is a teaching exercise and not for sale or distribution without acknowledgment from the team members.

## Installation and Contribution

For users, this application is still a work in progress and not ready to be run yet.

For contributors, we recommend using VS Code as a code editor unless you already have a preferred program. Downloads can be found on [the main VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com) and installation instructions can be found on [their documentation pages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview). We plan to include a VS Code `.code-workspace` file in the repo to standardize the extensions that the team uses.

Open tickets can be found on the Project Board here: https://github.com/nashvillefcc/local-weather-app/projects/1. If you would like to contribute, please inform the team on the Discord channel before beginning work. For each ticket, create a feature branch off of our Develop branch and create a Pull Request when it is complete. Project Managers listed above will review each Pull Request before it is accepted and merged.
